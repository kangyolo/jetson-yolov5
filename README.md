# YOLOv5 on Jetson Nano

## Clone the Repository
We are using custom Ubuntu 20.04 and we just need a couple update in Jetson Nano for YOLOv5.
```
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5.git
```
the custom ubuntu has a custom library too, so we just need some small tunning to run YOLOv5
copy and paste the [custom req file]
